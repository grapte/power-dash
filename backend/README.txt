The reason why `node_modules` are also committed along with the rest of the project is due to expediency. 

TODO: impliment tree shakers and minimizers to bundle main.js so that it is the only file remaining in commit without any dependecies. (OR actually commit the server code without node_modules but with the extra implimentation that minimizes it)
TODO: find better data sources
TODO: generate better data
